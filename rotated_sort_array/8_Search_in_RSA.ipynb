    "Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: left and right pointers mark the boundaries of our search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search: We use binary search principles, repeatedly calculating the middle index (mid).\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Found: If nums[mid] is the target, we return mid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking Sorted Halves: We determine which half of the array is sorted by comparing nums[left] and nums[mid].\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting Search Space: Based on where the target could potentially lie, we adjust left or right accordingly. This lets us narrow our focus to the relevant half of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Not Found: If the loop finishes without finding the target, we return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the Code Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to understanding this algorithm is the fact that in a rotated sorted array, one half will always be sorted. Once we determine the sorted half, we can apply typical \n",
    "binary search logic within that half.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] and target = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the left half is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since target is in the range of the sorted half, we narrow our search to the left half.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue this, until we find the target at index 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: Each iteration of the loop cuts the search space in half, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you would like to see how this code works with specific test cases or have any other questions!\n",
